Fitness Trackr is a exercise planning and tracking site. This project uses React v18 for the front end and Express and postgreSQL for the backend. The site fetches from the API at *[Fitness Trackr API](https://my-fitness-trackr.onrender.com/api)* to Create, Read, Update, and Destroy data with user authentication via JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
